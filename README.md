# Stack Reloaded
Open source Unity3D version of Ketchapp's popular mobile app, Stack.

Aiming to include additional features after the core features are in place.

## Getting Started
Built with [Unity 2019.1.4f1](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive "Find version 2019.1.4 on download page") targeting Android SDK version 21. Due to the simplicity of the code, any modern version of Unity should build the app just fine.

## Releases
No public releases are available yet, but feel free to build your own.
